#iPrepared
A simple disaster preparation Android app I made my freshman year of high school in 2013 for FLL (First Lego League) team Blazing Phoenix, which I was mentoring.

##Features##
1. Percent of how prepared you are for a natural disaster based on your checklists
2. Drill Reminder Scheduling
3. Disaster Preparation Task List
4. Home/School/Work/Car supply checklists with definable expiration dates and expiration reminders

Task/Supply Lists are from national government agencies.
